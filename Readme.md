<p>This is simple app where you can set timer to shutdown your PC.</p>
<p>It was few years ago that time i just started learning C#, One night i feel that i need simple programme for setting a timer to shutdown my pc.
I used to download large amount of file sometimes (In Bangladesh download speed was 128KB/Sec) and i thought it is a good idea to start download then set timer and sleep. </P>
