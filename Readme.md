# PC Shutdown Timer

![PC Shutdown Timer](pc-shutdown-timer.png)

**PC Shutdown Timer** is a simple application that allows you to set a timer for shutting down your computer. This project is a result of my early experiences with C#. A few years ago, when I was just starting to learn C#, I found the need for a straightforward program that would help me automate the process of shutting down my PC.

## Project Background

The inspiration for this project came from those nights when I used to download large files, especially in a region with limited internet speed. In my case, the download speed was a mere 128KB/Sec, so I thought it would be a convenient idea to initiate a download, set a timer for the shutdown, and simply go to sleep.

## Project Details
